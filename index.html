        <p>Design visualization is most directly connected to two forms of description: the drawing and the model. The
                drawing is a static composition created by the designer to communicate characteristics of the project
                from a fixed point of view. A model is also a static description of an object, however its engagement
                with a viewer is not. A person may walk around it, remove pieces, and if the model is small enough, pick
                it up. A person can change the position of the model in space, but they cannot change its color, scale,
                size or configuration. The model and the drawing are used to convey fixed ideas to be understood and
                discussed. They are also the outputs of a workflow that leverages the iterative power of computation,
                allowing designers to engage interactive software in the production of static objects.
        </p>


        <p>Software provides an incredible environment for interacting with media. It allows for multiple users to
                collaborate, share and remix ideas. Paradoxically, design representation did not adopt these
                characteristics when the drawing was transposed into a digital environment. Drawings are often
                communicated in the file formats of .jpeg, .png, .tiff and .pdf. These formats are static and while they
                may be “edited” the source of the content—a digital model—has been disconnected from the file and cannot
                be changed. Even when we consider the file formats of .mp4 for video, this is a simply a collection of
                images, and although the information changes over time the source content remains inaccessible. This is
                not unintentional. Design representation has been crafted over four-hundred years to communicate ideas
                through static and immutable artifacts that preserve intent.
        </p>
        <p>This semester, students will be asked to craft software in lieu of drawings or models. Students will consider
                how the interaction between a user and their design software will engage specific architectural problems
                that have been established in the fall research seminar. The software projects are not meant to be
                consumer products that will aid in the design process, instead they should be seen as prototypes that
                propose imaginative and at times novel means of drawing interaction to image, fabricate, and generate
                architecture
